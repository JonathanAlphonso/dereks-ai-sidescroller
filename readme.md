Sidescroller where the player character starts in the center of a procedurally generated area of platforms where waves of enemies spawn from the far left and right of the area and are drawn towards the player character and will attack and damage the player character if within a close enough range. Player character has a move set including a jump, a ground pound that removes horizontal momentum when in air, and immediately sets vertical momentum to be negative, plummeting to the ground to create a Shockwave, knocking enemies back. All attacks have physics associated and impact their target(s) with knockback, with direction being dependent on the move used: uppercut knocks enemies upwards, spike knocks them downwards, horizontal attacks knock them back horizontally, and some attacks have effects knocking enemies in angles between at 45Â°, or are meant as "jabs" that briefly stun, rather than knocking back, but don't cause as much damage. When an enemy, or even the player character contact a surface that suddenly stops their momentum (hitting the ground after a long fall or a wall after being blasted horizontally) they take damage relative to the velocity lost upon impact.
